## Introduction

LeetCode is a platform for enhancing oneâ€™s programming skills through practicing with coding questions often asked in
technical interviews. This repository contains my personal solutions to these problems, which I've categorized by
difficulty level and problem type for ease of navigation.

## Language

The solutions in this repository are primarily written in Java.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `/easy` - Solutions to easy problems
- `/medium` - Solutions to medium problems
- `/hard` - Solutions to hard problems
